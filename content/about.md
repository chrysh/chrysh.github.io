This blog got started out as a way to document my way into writing **Linux Kernel
modules** in **Rust**. It seemed hard to find information on this topic, so I
started out first with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) in 2024
in order to learn Rust. From challenge to challenge, I feel like [my
code](https://github.com/chrysh/Advent-of-Code-2023) became more "rusty".

But then I quickly moved to exploring the current state of Rust in the Linux
kernel, compiled and loaded the first examples and ported my first phy driver.
Come with me on my journey of discovery!

# about::me
After finishing a diploma in Computer Science and a masters in Electrical
Engineering, I have been working in the field of Embedded Linux for nearly a
decade now. From time to time, I do fun projects and talks about it.

Check out my latest talks at [ELCE](https://www.embeddedlinuxconference.com/):

* [Common Attacks on IoT Devices - ELCE 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZVbX-hNyE)
* [Exploiting Buffer Overflows on RISC-V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBhaw49qooE)
* [Analysing colliding particles with 256 Threads - Performance of an embarrassingly
parallel problem on the Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing](https://media.ccc.de/v/EBEZQG)
