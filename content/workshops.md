# about::mission
Modern systems require the performance of C with the safety of Rust. I help companies bridge this gap by providing hands-on training for Embedded Rust and Rust for Linux.

My goal is to help your team reduce memory-safety bugs and modernize legacy codebases without losing the low-level control required for kernel and hardware development.

# about::modules

## Rust for Linux Kernel Developers

For teams maintaining drivers or moving toward upstream kernel standards.

    The Framework: Navigating the kernel crate and current abstractions.

    Driver Porting: Strategies for migrating C drivers (PHY, char, etc.) to Rust.

    Safe vs Unsafe: Understanding the boundary and writing sound abstractions.

    Tooling: Setting up the environment, Kbuild integration, and debugging.

## Embedded Rust (no_std)

For firmware engineers moving from traditional C-based MCU development.

    The Ecosystem: Working with embedded-hal and Peripheral Access Crates.

    Concurrency: Implementing safe multitasking with frameworks like RTIC.

    Zero-Cost Abstractions: Leveraging the type system for hardware safety.

    Modern Debugging: Using probe-rs and defmt for better observability.

## Migration & Strategy

Consulting for architects and lead engineers.

    Interoperability: Seamlessly mixing C and Rust using bindgen.

    Risk Assessment: Identifying high-risk components for early migration.

    Safety Audits: Finding "low-hanging fruit" to eliminate common memory bugs.

# about::expertise

With a background in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and over a decade of Embedded Linux experience, I bridge the gap between high-level safety and low-level hardware constraints. I don't just teach the language; I teach how it interacts with hardware and the kernel.

For a full list of my technical talks and background, see the [About page](/about).
