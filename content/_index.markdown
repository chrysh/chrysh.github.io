# Rusty Linux tech blog

## Yet another blogger

When I recently became curious about what the current state of Rust integreation
in the Linux Kernel was, I found example drivers online that did not compile
with the mainline kernel and there was no good source to explain what the
current state of progress is. So I started my own blog, with the goal to get a
patch written in Rust accepted in mainline, and share my learnings along the
way. Enjoy!
