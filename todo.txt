Let's look at the following code, that tries to open a file. This operation
could fail.

```
use std::fs::File;

fn open_file(path: &str) -> Result<File, std::io::Error> {
    File::open(path)
}
```

If the functions opened the file successfully, `Ok(file)` is returned. If it
fails, `Error(io::Error)` is returned.


When a function returns a pointer, and the operation fails, usually `NULL` is
returned to signal an error. Rust uses `Option<T>` for that.
The following function would return `Some(index)` if an item is found, and
`None` otherwise:

```

```

The `?` operator than unwraps the `Ok` value.

When you write `expression?`, the Rust compiler expands it into something like
this:

```
match expression {
    Ok(value) => value,
    Err(err) => return Err(From::from(err)),
}
```

```
match expression {
    Some(value) => value,
    None => return None,
}
```
